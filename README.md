# Single-Purpose Site

Create a single-purpose website, which tells the user one thing, a la [Is It Christmas?](https://isitchristmas.com/). It can be something based on:

* The current date
* The time
* The weather
* Whether Kanye West's most recent tweets mention Kanye West
* *etc*

Surprise and delight us â€“ creativity is encouraged. **Deploy the application to Heroku**, and **submit a pull request** to this repository. Include:

* All the necessary files
* In the README:
    * Setup instructions
    * A link to the live app on Heroku
